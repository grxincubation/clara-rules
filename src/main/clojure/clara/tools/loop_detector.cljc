   Max-cycles is the maximum

   plus the number of times all rules are evaluated and their facts inserted, thus leading
   to another cycle of rules activations in the same activation group. 

   on-limit-fn is a 0-arg function that is invoked exactly once when this limit is exceeded.  It can either be
   a user-provided function or a keyword that indicates a built-in function to use.  Currently supported keywords are:

   :throw-exception - This throws an exception when the limit is reached.  If tracing is enabled, the exception will include
   the trace.

   :standard-out-warning - This prints a warning to standard out."
